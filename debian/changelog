upmpdcli (0.8.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * libupnpp control: Use libcurl to perform the description document
    download. Previously, the bad timeout management in libupnp would allow
    a very slow or sick device to basically DOS the discovery process. This
    has no consequences for upmpdcli proper (only the control side of the
    lib), beyond introducing a libcurl dependancy, which mpd itself needs
    anyway (if it's going to accept urls).

# TO-DO-LIST

I am collecting ideas in this file, so I don't forget what I'd like to add to the subsonic plugin.

- Search: show exact matches first
- Implement search using database if preloading is active
- Implement search on playlists
- Album browser: implement formatting for values like Quality Badge, Sampling Rate, BitDepth etc
- Album browser: implement sorting on specific values like QualityBadge, Sampling Rate, BitDepth
- Show contributors in album view
- Sort favorite albums
- Sort favorite artists
- Don't show artists with 0 releases among additional artists

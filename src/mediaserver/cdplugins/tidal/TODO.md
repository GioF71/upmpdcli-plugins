# TO-DO-LIST

I am collecting ideas in this file, so I don't forget what I'd like to add to this plugin.

- List of artists for an album: if there are too many, offer a dedicated link so that the album view opens more rapidly
- track_to_track_container: add artist information
- track_to_track_container: format title as title by [artist] from [album]. Add " from [album]" on if title of track != album title (so for singles we have a cleaner entry)

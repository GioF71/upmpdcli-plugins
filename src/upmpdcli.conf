# this file.

# Host MPD runs on. Defaults to localhost. This can also be specified as -h host
#mpdhost = localhost

# Port for MPD. Can also be specified as -p port
#mpdport = 6600

# MPD password
#mpdpassword =

# Displayed "Friendly Name" for the UPnP Media Renderer

# Save queue metadata to disk to allow persistence across restart, like MPD.
ohmetapersist = 1

# Mimimum interval (Seconds) between 2 saves of the cache. Setting this may

# inbetween).
# ohmetasleep = 0

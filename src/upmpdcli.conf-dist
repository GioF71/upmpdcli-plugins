# Initial / default List of radios borrowed from misc sources. Edit to taste
#
# Maybe this should be XML, but it's not. The section markers are the radio
# names, and then there are two possible entries:
#  url (mandatory) points to the radio playlist or stream
#  artUrl (optional) points to the radio icon

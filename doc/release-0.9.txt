= Notes for the upmpdcli 0.9 release series

*upmpdcli* 0.9 implements support for link:sc2mpd.html[Linn Songcast]. This
is mostly an addition to the unchanged 0.8.6 code, so, when not using
Songcast, it should be as stable as 0.8.6.

== Bugs fixed since 0.8.6

- Fix the _Kazoo_ Control Point going loopy when the upmpdcli playlist
  became empty.

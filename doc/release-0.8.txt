= Notes for upmpdcli 0.8 release series

== Changes in upmpdcli 0.8.0

The main changes in release 0.8 deal with better handling of the OpenHome
playlist, in addition to a number of small bug fixes, and efficiency
improvements.

- OpenHome playlist: metadata from tracks directly added to the MPD queue
  through an MPD client (such as, e.g. MPDroid, gmpc...) is now remembered
  by *upmpdcli* and will be displayed in the UPnP control point.
- OpenHome playlist: the metadata for the playlist is now saved to disk so
  that it survives restarts (like the MPD playlist does). The previous
  situation was that the current playing queue was still active after a
  player restart, but no metadata (titles, artists, etc.) was displayed.
- Actually advertise on the network when starting up and dying. An
  oversight in previous versions resulted in the fact that *upmpdcli* could
  only be discovered by a search (when the control point started), but,
  when *upmpdcli* was started, it would not appear in a running control point
  device list. 
- Do not advertise support for raw PCM strings (audio/Lxx), as we can't
  actually play them. It is better to give accurate information to the
  control point, so that it can choose an alternate format such as Wav if
  it is available.

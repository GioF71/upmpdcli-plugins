= Upmpdcli: MPD UPnP Renderer Front-End


*upmpdcli* is an UPnP Media Renderer front-end to *MPD*, the Music Player
Daemon. 

== Configuration
[[upmpdcli.config]]

See the man page for command line details. In most situations, *upmpdcli*
will be run as follows:

    upmpdcli -D -c /etc/upmpdcli.conf

The `-D` option tells *upmpdcli* to fork and run in background. The `-c`
option specifies a configuration file.

The configuration file has a simple `name = value` format.

The configuration parameters can be set from the command line, a
configuration file, or the environment in this order of priority. It would
be rather confusing to use a mix of methods, so you should probably chose
one. 

The following parameters can be set:

|========================
|What|Command line|Environment|Config variable
|Configuration file name|-c config|$UPMPD_CONFIG|
|Host name or IP address where *MPD* runs|-h mpdhost|$UPMPD_HOST|mpdhost
|TCP port for *MPD*|-p mpdport|$UPMPD_PORT|mpdport
|*MPD* password|||mpdpassword
|Do we own the *MPD* queue and fearlessly clear it|-o 0/1||ownqueue
|UPnP "friendly name" for the device. This gets displayed in network search
  results.|-f friendlyname|$UPMPD_FRIENDLYNAME|friendlyname 
|Log file name. Leave empty for stderr|-d logfilename||logfilename
|Verbosity level (0-4)|-l loglevel||loglevel
|===========================    

[[upmpdcli.boot]]
== Boot time startup

*upmpdcli* will try to change its `uid` to user `upmpdcli` if it is
started by root. It will refuse to run if the user does not exist.

If started by `root`, *upmpdcli* will also write its process id to
`/var/run/upmpdcli.pid`.

There are boot-time startup scripts in the `debian/` directory inside the
source tree (for Debian/Ubuntu/Mint/Raspbian etc.). There is also a systemd
service file under `systemd/` (for Fedora et al.).

The boot scripts are installed by the pre-built packages, so will just have
to edit the configuration file after installing them, all the rest should
just work.

[[upmpdcli.building]]
== Building

For building from source, you will need a recent `C++` compiler (`C++11`),
and the development packages for *libupnp* version 1.6, and *libmpdclient*.

If you are using the source from Github, you will also need the
autoconf/automake/libtool trio. Use the `autogen.sh` script to set things
up.

Otherwise, the procedure is standard and there are currently no specific
configure options:

    configure --prefix=/usr
    make
    sudo make install

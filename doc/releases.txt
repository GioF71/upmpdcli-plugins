= Upmpdcli release notes

== libupnpp 0.15.3

* Volume control fix (events carried wrong value if device range
  was not 0-100).
* Fix crash on service object delete (callback table not cleared).
* Improved reliability of discovery.


== upplay 1.2.9

- Do not list Receiver sources in source list, nothing useful can be done
  by selecting them.

== upmpdcli 1.2.14

- Make Receiver OpenHome source visible to allow control by Linn Kazoo

== libupnpp 0.15.2

- Handle "Waiting" state to allow control of Linn Songcast Receivers

== sc2mpd 1.1.3

- Updates to the build system. Small code reorganization and fixes. No
  external changes.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.13

- Improved handling of Qobuz favorites.
- Improved dynamic radio artwork processing.
- Allow media-server only mode (no talking to mpd, incomplete), and other
  small changes for supporting the experimental local media server module.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.12

- Fixes the 1.2.11 Content Directory bug.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.11

- Allow dynamic retrieving of radio stream artwork.
- Improved Qobuz interface.

NOTE: Known Bug: when accessing the streaming services plugins from Linn
Kazoo (and maybe some others), only the very beginning of each directory is
displayed (1-2 entries). This is a bug in upmpdcli, and a new version will
be released shortly to correct it. Meanwhile, you can use Upplay or Bubble
UPNP which do things in a different way and are not affected by the issue.


== Upmpdcli 1.2.10

- Improves streaming services search
- Fix bug in UPnP/AV mode (seeking after gapless transition would not
  work).
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.6/7/8/9

- Small fixes (qobuz,tidal), added protocolinfo entries, etc.
- 1.2.9 fixes a bug in the format of the protocolinfo data sent to the
        control points. 

== Upmpdcli 1.2.5

- Tidal repaired (you only need the tidal Python code, the rest of upmpdcli
  is unchanged).
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.4

- Misc bug fixes.
- Split the Debian / Ubuntu packages to separate the main package from the
  different streaming services ones.
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.0

- Implement gateway to Google Play Music, Qobuz and Tidal by exporting a 
  Media Server UPnP device.
- The code now uses c++11 features, and the default build uses -std=c++11,
  meaning that the minimum usable gcc version is 4.7.
- Implement support for embedded devices in libupnpp

== Upmpdcli 1.1.4

- Support audio/L16 format (only works with patched mpd 0.19.16jfd1 until
  mpd gets to 0.20).
- Make Volume/Mute events conform to standard (JRiver did not like our
  non-standard events).
- Allow defining radio station in an out-of-install file.
- Add content format compatibility checking. Can be disabled by setting
  checkcontentformat to 0.
- Other small fixes.

== Upmpdcli 1.1.3

- Fix cover art display, which sometimes vanished.
- Allow changing the xml data directory in the run time config.
- Fix execution of onvolumechange (command could not have args).

== Upmpdcli 1.1.2

- Fixed the mpd play method for the Songcast Receiver, it was broken in
  1.1.1. Even if the direct alsa is preferred, it can be useful in case of
  alsa trouble.
  
== Upmpdcli 1.1.1

- Compatibility with Linn Kazoo (also needs libupnp-1.6.19.jfd3).
- Improve management of play and volume state when switching between sources
- Allow volume control to be performed by an external script

== Upmpdcli 1.1

- Implement an OpenHome Radio source for playing Internet radio streams
  (needs Python).
- Add capability to forward ALSA input channel (or other audio source) to
  Songcast (needs sc2mpd 0.14).
- Fix Receiver detection from Windows Songcast
- Lose the 0.x as we are reaching maturity...
- Needs libupnpp 0.14.1

== Upmpdcli 0.13

- Support the new sc2mpd/mpd2sc Sender/Receiver mode, allowing broadcasting
  the audio from the Linux host to multiple Songcast receivers (typically
  other upmpdcli/sc2mpd instances but should also work with other
  types). Previous versions needed a Windows or Mac Sender for multiroom
  audio.
- Fix bug where we did not clear mpd "single" mode, resulting in needing to
  hit play after each track (in openhome playlist mode).
- Fix random initial value for ohproduct standby state variable (0.13.1)
- Fix eventing for ohproduct (0.13.1)


== Upmpdcli 0.12

This has a small change to use a new feature in libupnpp 0.12 to suppress
error messages produced when when UPnP AV services were turned off.
The version number was changed mostly to signal the dependancy on libupnpp
0.12.

== Upmpdcli 0.11

*upmpdcli* 0.11 mainly improves the *Songcast* support, in complement with
the changes in *sc2mpd*. Especially, it now includes an utility (*scctl*)
and WEB interface to set up multi-room *Songcast*.

Minor releases:

0.11.2::
    Add an `upnpav` configuration variable, to enable turning off UPnP AV
    support (on by default). Turning off UPnP AV allows the Linn Kinsky
    control point to work smoothly with upmpdcli (it gets confused when
    both OpenHome and UPnP AV services are enabled).


== Upmpdcli 0.9

*upmpdcli* 0.9 implements support for link:sc2mpd.html[Linn Songcast]. This
is mostly an addition to the unchanged 0.8.6 code, so, when not using
Songcast, it should be as stable as 0.8.6.

Bugs fixed: 
     
- Fix the _Kazoo_ Control Point going loopy when the upmpdcli playlist
  became empty.


== Upmpdcli 0.8

0.8.6::
Small improvements:
* Improved speed for loading big playqueues. 
* Fixed quoting for tracks added from an MPD client.

0.8.5::
No code changes, it only exists because of changes in the
package structure. The libupnpp library has been separated in its own
package.

0.8.4::
Skipped.

0.8.3::
This release mostly has modifications to the control side of the library.
* upmpdcli now retries some song delete operations, it seems that mpd
  sometimes needs a little time to recover (?)
* The control side now uses short timeouts and concurrency to download
  the description documents, which should solve the problem of devices
  disappearing when a very slow-responding one was present on the network.
* Misc improvements to the control side of the lib to support upplay.

0.8.2::
* Add capability to set an icon to be displayed when selecting a renderer
  from a control point (see iconpath parameter in configuration file).
* Control side: fix volume control which was not working on many renderers.
* Misc changes to ease compilation on non-glibc platforms.

0.8.1::
Many changes in the library code, but almost none of them affect the
device side, they concern support for writing a control-point, which is
mostly disjoint. The following changes are relevant to upmpdcli, and
consistant with a minor release:

* When used with an non-OpenHome Control Point, multiple calls to
  SetNextTransportURI no longer result in a lengthening of the MPD queue,
  and a wrong playlist.
* The OpenHome Playlist metadata is now writen to a temporary file which
  is then renamed, to avoid partial saves of big lists.
* The AVTransport service uses the OpenHome PlayList metadata cache
  for describing the current track data to a pure AVTransport Control
  Point. This is a very marginal improvement, and only makes sense in case
  the AVTransport CP is used for displaying the current track.
* The OpenHome service was not completly switched off when the option was
  off sometimes resulting in spurious error messages (and nothing more).
* Bad lock management inside the device code could result in a
  semi-deadlock in rare situations. Upmpdcli would then mostly be gone from
  the network, while still doing temporary appearances. This is linked to
  design issues in libupnp, which handles quite badly a situation where a
  subscribed Control Point responds very slowly or not at all to event
  connections.

0.8.0::

The main changes in release 0.8 deal with better handling of the OpenHome
playlist, in addition to a number of small bug fixes, and efficiency
improvements.

- OpenHome playlist: metadata from tracks directly added to the MPD queue
  through an MPD client (such as, e.g. MPDroid, gmpc...) is now remembered
  by *upmpdcli* and will be displayed in the UPnP Control Point.

- OpenHome playlist: the metadata for the playlist is now saved to disk so
  that it survives restarts (like the MPD playlist does). The previous
  situation was that the current playing queue was still active after a
  player restart, but no metadata (titles, artists, etc.) was displayed.

- Actually advertise on the network when starting up and dying. An
  oversight in previous versions resulted in the fact that *upmpdcli* could
  only be discovered by a search (when the Control Point started), but,
  when *upmpdcli* was started, it would not appear in a running Control Point
  device list. 

- Do not advertise support for raw PCM strings (audio/Lxx), as we can't
  actually play them. It is better to give accurate information to the
  Control Point, so that it can choose an alternate format such as Wav if
  it is available.

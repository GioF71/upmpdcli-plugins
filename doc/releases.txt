  manual). Allows better synchronisation, especially with non-sc2mpd
  receivers.

== 2020-04-01 sc2mpd 1.1.6

- Allow adjusting the stream volume according to the mpd current setting
  (allows adjusting from control point connected to upmpdcli). Set
  'scusempdvolume' to true in the config to activate.
  
== 2020-03-06 libnpupnp 2.2.1

- Fix 1.4.6 issues with Kazoo.

== 2020-02-25 libnpupnp 2.1.1

- Fix different issues in network configuration code, including an outright
  crash.

== 2020-02-07 upmpdcli 1.4.6

- Multiple small fixes, some in the radio scripts, most regarding the build
  system.
- Avoid mpd remaining in 'single' mode after switching back from the Radio
  Source.
- Remove the libupnp dependancy from the packages. We only depend on
  libupnpp (which in turns depends on libnpupnp).

== 2020-02-07 libupnpp 0.18.0

- Switch to using libnpupnp. The slightly different API means that we are
  not compatible any more with libupnp, but we get rid of the libixml
  dependance and the libupnp history of bugs so this is a big win.

== 2020-02-07 libnpupnp 2.0.1

- Initial release.
- The 2.0.0 API is not compatible with the pupnp/libupnp API, this was
  necessary to get rid of libixml and the weirdness of passing DOM trees
  across the API.
- There is a 1.0.0 version in the git history which marks the last point
  where libnpupnp preserves the libupnp API. Most of the other changes
  (switching to C++ internally, relying on expat, libcurl and
  libmicrohttpd) had already be done at this point.

== 2020-02-06 upplay 1.4.3

- Better scaling in the player area.
- Improve column alignement in directory browser.
- Use new npupnp library on Debian

== 2019-11-03 upplay 1.4.2

== 2019-10-15 upmpdcli 1.4.5

- Plug some of the memory leaks in the Spotify interface.
- Extracted the Qobuz app_key/secret from the code. Get it from the
  configuration instead. This should make it easy for an integrator to
  store it securely.

== 2019-09-27 libupnpp 0.17.2

- API cleanup: remove upnp.h  and config.h from public interfaces.
- Fix crash with newer libstdc++ (buster).

== 2019-08-09 upplay 1.4.1

New display modes in the directory section, with more use of the album
covers, either inside the lists or as main presentation element.

== 2019-09-16 upmpdcli 1.4.4

- Add plgmicrohttphost variable to allow setting the host used in proxy
  urls. This allows using localhost, which will only work with the local
  renderer, but allows for portable playlists.
- Fix a number of small issues in the gmusic plugin.
- Better updates for radio stream metadata, esp. when not using OHRadio.


== 2019-03-28 libupnpp 0.17.1

- Pupnp 1.8 compatibility

== 2019-03-28 upmpdcli 1.4.2

- Restore capability to run without UPnP-AV support at all.
- Fix removing tracks from the OpenHome Playlist. This was not working
  right when removing more than a few tracks.
  
== 2019-02-13 upmpdcli 1.4.1

- Fix bug in Spotify plugin

== 2019-01-15 upmpdcli 1.4.0

- Save the current radio settings across restarts.
- Add the avtautoplay config variable to accommodate a non-conformant
  Control Point which does not issue a Play command after SetAVTransportURI.
- Add mpdtimeoutms variable to configure MPD connections timeouts.
- Use Python 3 for all scripts
- gmusic: cache some data locally to improve performance.
- OHCredentials: use stored authentication data if available to avoid login
  on CP.
- Uprcl: use Waitress as WSGI server, instead of Paste.
- Fix issue in Spotify access when started by root (at boot time).
- Qobuz: allow longer playlists
- Use the libupnpp 0.17.0 features. This makes us incompatible with 0.16.
- Add the capability to run the Media Server in-process (as a separate root
  device). Needs a very recent libupnp.

== 2019-01-15 libupnpp 0.17.0

- Better support for embedded devices.
- Support for multiple root devices.
- Move the description document creation to the library: it is built
  incrementally as services are added, instead of being passed as a whole
  by the device. This changes the API.
- Don't delay searches after the initial one.
- Work around port allocation bug in some libupnp 1.8 versions.

== 2018-12-13 upmpdcli 1.3.8
- Add parameter to set the name of the openssl command to use. Helps with
  OHCredentials on jessie where the system command is too old.
- Small compatibility change for helping Kazoo use our radio list. Better
  Kazoo compatibility (when switching between radio and playlist) still to
  come (not merged).

== 2018-12-14 libupnpp 0.16.2
- Compatibility with libupnp branch 1.8

== 2018-12-12 upmpdcli 1.3.7

- Allow setting the name of the openssl command used to encrypt the
  credentials. 

== 2018-10-08 upmpdcli 1.3.6

- Fix issues in the Credentials service which prevented Tidal and Qobuz
  logins to work with BubbleUPnP.
  
== 2018-10-06 upmpdcli 1.3.5

- Fix bug in the spotify plugin: would not work if upmpdcli was initially
  started by root (before switching to the upmpdcli user), which is the
  default for the packages.

== 2018-10-01 upmpdcli 1.3.4

- Fix bug in the spotify plugin: would not work if plgproxymethod was set
  to redirect (which is the default). The plugin should ignore the value of
  this variable which can only be useful for the other streaming services.
  
== 2018-09-20 upmpdcli 1.3.3

- Fix the radio source on systems with Python3 version older than 3.5
  (e.g. Debian Jessie)
  
== 2018-09-15 upmpdcli 1.3.2

NOTE: Using this release with Lumin needs explicitely setting lumincompat=1
in the configuration file, which disables the OpenHome Credentials service
(this is not the default).

- Support Spotify, through a new Media Server module. This needs a premium
  Spotify account. The setup is slightly more complicated than for the
  other services, see the
  link:https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/upmpdcli-manual.html#upmpdcli.spotifynotes[upmpdcli manual]
- Support the OpenHome Credentials service. This allows accessing Qobuz and
  Tidal from Kazoo, using their internal service directory browser (instead
  of going through the upmpdcli media server). This allows managing
  favourites and other specific service functions. In theory, this should
  work with Lumin too, but it does not, and the presence of this feature
  prevents the renderer from being detected by Lumin at all, so that a
  'lumincompat' was added to the configuration to allow using upmpdcli with
  Lumin (with the Credentials support disabled).
- Support Radio Paradise FLAC channel. This is special for a radio because
  it uses a sequence of audio URLs instead of a single stream. Have a look
  at the distributed 'upmpdcli.conf' file for the radio definition to use
  (add it to your '/etc/upmpdcli.conf' which is not automatically updated
  during an upgrade). The appropriate script is now installed to
  '/usr/share/upmpdcli/radio_scripts' (along with a small number of art and
  metadata scripts for other stations).
- Port all Python code to Python3 (while retaining Python2
  compatibility). All Media Server plugins are run by Python3 by default.
- Improve function with Google Play Music. Esp. fix bugs in playlist
  handling.
- Add proxy mode to the Media Server. This may improve function in
  case the service is a bit flaky by providing retries. The default is
  still to redirect mpd to the actual music stream, except for Spotify
  (which needs local decoding).

See the
link:https://www.lesbonscomptes.com/upmpdcli/upmpdcli-manual.html[Upmpdcli
manual] for more detail about these functions. 

== 2018-04-06 sc2mpd 1.1.5

- Improved handling of halt state.
- Narrower range of sample rate adjustments to avoid extreme strangeness.
- Openhome updates. Switch to Joerg Krause repository on GitHub because
  Linn OhSongcast does not appear to be maintained any more.
  
== 2018-04-06 upmpdcli 1.2.16

- Multiple small fixes for crashes in rare circumstances.
- New GUI editor for the configuration file (not built by default, use
  configure --enable-confgui, which in turns needs qt5 dev modules).
- Add wavpack, APE to supported formats (used checkcontentformat is set).
- Reset MPD single, random, and repeat modes when needed (SetAVTransportURI).
- Radios: add preferScript parameter to override Icy metadata with the one
  fetched by the script.
- Radios: support HTTPS.
- Fix Tidal search and other issues in the Tidal and Qobuz modules (crashes).
- Fix handling of Qobuz and Tidal playlists (recently broken).
- Media Server: allow configuring the names for the plugin entries
  in the server root (e.g. uprcl -> "Local Music")
- New GUI editor for the configuration file (not built by default, use
  configure --enable-confgui, which in turns needs qt5 dev modules).
- OpenHome Receivers: add possibility to use a state file, allowing the
  Receiver to reconnect to the previous Sender when starting up
- uprcl plugin (Media Server for local files): multiple improvements, still alpha
  quality.

== 2017-09-19 sc2mpd 1.1.4

- Better handling of transition to stop state and process exit, properly
  close ALSA when needed.
- Update the openhome code version.

== libupnpp 0.16.1

* Small additions to the Songcast control interface.
* Worked around possible crash when calling UpnpCloseLog()
* Mac OS X build tweaks

== libupnpp 0.16.0

* Interfaces used by the Python binding merged into the main branch.
* New interface for dumping a device description files (used from upplay).

== upmpdcli 1.2.15

* Faster Qobuz searches (less requests to the service)
* Songcast: stop the inactive sender so that it does not show up in
  lists.
* Radio dynamic metadata scripts for radio which provide metadata from
  the web site, instead of icy metadata.
* Properly handle radios which redirect straight from http to mms.
* AVTransport: accept metadata-less streams.
 

== libupnpp 0.15.3

* Volume control fix (events carried wrong value if device range
  was not 0-100).
* Fix crash on service object delete (callback table not cleared).
* Improved reliability of discovery.


== upplay 1.2.9

- Do not list Receiver sources in source list, nothing useful can be done
  by selecting them.

== upmpdcli 1.2.14

- Make Receiver OpenHome source visible to allow control by Linn Kazoo

== libupnpp 0.15.2

- Handle "Waiting" state to allow control of Linn Songcast Receivers

== sc2mpd 1.1.3

- Updates to the build system. Small code reorganization and fixes. No
  external changes.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.13

- Improved handling of Qobuz favorites.
- Improved dynamic radio artwork processing.
- Allow media-server only mode (no talking to mpd, incomplete), and other
  small changes for supporting the experimental local media server module.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.12

- Fixes the 1.2.11 Content Directory bug.

== Upmpdcli 1.2.11

- Allow dynamic retrieving of radio stream artwork.
- Improved Qobuz interface.

NOTE: Known Bug: when accessing the streaming services plugins from Linn
Kazoo (and maybe some others), only the very beginning of each directory is
displayed (1-2 entries). This is a bug in upmpdcli, and a new version will
be released shortly to correct it. Meanwhile, you can use Upplay or Bubble
UPNP which do things in a different way and are not affected by the issue.


== Upmpdcli 1.2.10

- Improves streaming services search
- Fix bug in UPnP/AV mode (seeking after gapless transition would not
  work).
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.6/7/8/9

- Small fixes (qobuz,tidal), added protocolinfo entries, etc.
- 1.2.9 fixes a bug in the format of the protocolinfo data sent to the
        control points. 

== Upmpdcli 1.2.5

- Tidal repaired (you only need the tidal Python code, the rest of upmpdcli
  is unchanged).
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.4

- Misc bug fixes.
- Split the Debian / Ubuntu packages to separate the main package from the
  different streaming services ones.
  
== Upmpdcli 1.2.0

- Implement gateway to Google Play Music, Qobuz and Tidal by exporting a 
  Media Server UPnP device.
- The code now uses c++11 features, and the default build uses -std=c++11,
  meaning that the minimum usable gcc version is 4.7.
- Implement support for embedded devices in libupnpp

== Upmpdcli 1.1.4

- Support audio/L16 format (only works with patched mpd 0.19.16jfd1 until
  mpd gets to 0.20).
- Make Volume/Mute events conform to standard (JRiver did not like our
  non-standard events).
- Allow defining radio station in an out-of-install file.
- Add content format compatibility checking. Can be disabled by setting
  checkcontentformat to 0.
- Other small fixes.

== Upmpdcli 1.1.3

- Fix cover art display, which sometimes vanished.
- Allow changing the xml data directory in the run time config.
- Fix execution of onvolumechange (command could not have args).

== Upmpdcli 1.1.2

- Fixed the mpd play method for the Songcast Receiver, it was broken in
  1.1.1. Even if the direct alsa is preferred, it can be useful in case of
  alsa trouble.
  
== Upmpdcli 1.1.1

- Compatibility with Linn Kazoo (also needs libupnp-1.6.19.jfd3).
- Improve management of play and volume state when switching between sources
- Allow volume control to be performed by an external script

== Upmpdcli 1.1

- Implement an OpenHome Radio source for playing Internet radio streams
  (needs Python).
- Add capability to forward ALSA input channel (or other audio source) to
  Songcast (needs sc2mpd 0.14).
- Fix Receiver detection from Windows Songcast
- Lose the 0.x as we are reaching maturity...
- Needs libupnpp 0.14.1

== Upmpdcli 0.13

- Support the new sc2mpd/mpd2sc Sender/Receiver mode, allowing broadcasting
  the audio from the Linux host to multiple Songcast receivers (typically
  other upmpdcli/sc2mpd instances but should also work with other
  types). Previous versions needed a Windows or Mac Sender for multiroom
  audio.
- Fix bug where we did not clear mpd "single" mode, resulting in needing to
  hit play after each track (in openhome playlist mode).
- Fix random initial value for ohproduct standby state variable (0.13.1)
- Fix eventing for ohproduct (0.13.1)


== Upmpdcli 0.12

This has a small change to use a new feature in libupnpp 0.12 to suppress
error messages produced when when UPnP AV services were turned off.
The version number was changed mostly to signal the dependancy on libupnpp
0.12.

== Upmpdcli 0.11

*upmpdcli* 0.11 mainly improves the *Songcast* support, in complement with
the changes in *sc2mpd*. Especially, it now includes an utility (*scctl*)
and WEB interface to set up multi-room *Songcast*.

Minor releases:

0.11.2::
    Add an `upnpav` configuration variable, to enable turning off UPnP AV
    support (on by default). Turning off UPnP AV allows the Linn Kinsky
    control point to work smoothly with upmpdcli (it gets confused when
    both OpenHome and UPnP AV services are enabled).


== Upmpdcli 0.9

*upmpdcli* 0.9 implements support for link:sc2mpd.html[Linn Songcast]. This
is mostly an addition to the unchanged 0.8.6 code, so, when not using
Songcast, it should be as stable as 0.8.6.

Bugs fixed: 
     
- Fix the _Kazoo_ Control Point going loopy when the upmpdcli playlist
  became empty.


== Upmpdcli 0.8

0.8.6::
Small improvements:
* Improved speed for loading big playqueues. 
* Fixed quoting for tracks added from an MPD client.

0.8.5::
No code changes, it only exists because of changes in the
package structure. The libupnpp library has been separated in its own
package.

0.8.4::
Skipped.

0.8.3::
This release mostly has modifications to the control side of the library.
* upmpdcli now retries some song delete operations, it seems that mpd
  sometimes needs a little time to recover (?)
* The control side now uses short timeouts and concurrency to download
  the description documents, which should solve the problem of devices
  disappearing when a very slow-responding one was present on the network.
* Misc improvements to the control side of the lib to support upplay.

0.8.2::
* Add capability to set an icon to be displayed when selecting a renderer
  from a control point (see iconpath parameter in configuration file).
* Control side: fix volume control which was not working on many renderers.
* Misc changes to ease compilation on non-glibc platforms.

0.8.1::
Many changes in the library code, but almost none of them affect the
device side, they concern support for writing a control-point, which is
mostly disjoint. The following changes are relevant to upmpdcli, and
consistant with a minor release:

* When used with an non-OpenHome Control Point, multiple calls to
  SetNextTransportURI no longer result in a lengthening of the MPD queue,
  and a wrong playlist.
* The OpenHome Playlist metadata is now writen to a temporary file which
  is then renamed, to avoid partial saves of big lists.
* The AVTransport service uses the OpenHome PlayList metadata cache
  for describing the current track data to a pure AVTransport Control
  Point. This is a very marginal improvement, and only makes sense in case
  the AVTransport CP is used for displaying the current track.
* The OpenHome service was not completly switched off when the option was
  off sometimes resulting in spurious error messages (and nothing more).
* Bad lock management inside the device code could result in a
  semi-deadlock in rare situations. Upmpdcli would then mostly be gone from
  the network, while still doing temporary appearances. This is linked to
  design issues in libupnp, which handles quite badly a situation where a
  subscribed Control Point responds very slowly or not at all to event
  connections.

0.8.0::

The main changes in release 0.8 deal with better handling of the OpenHome
playlist, in addition to a number of small bug fixes, and efficiency
improvements.

- OpenHome playlist: metadata from tracks directly added to the MPD queue
  through an MPD client (such as, e.g. MPDroid, gmpc...) is now remembered
  by *upmpdcli* and will be displayed in the UPnP Control Point.

- OpenHome playlist: the metadata for the playlist is now saved to disk so
  that it survives restarts (like the MPD playlist does). The previous
  situation was that the current playing queue was still active after a
  player restart, but no metadata (titles, artists, etc.) was displayed.

- Actually advertise on the network when starting up and dying. An
  oversight in previous versions resulted in the fact that *upmpdcli* could
  only be discovered by a search (when the Control Point started), but,
  when *upmpdcli* was started, it would not appear in a running Control Point
  device list. 

- Do not advertise support for raw PCM strings (audio/Lxx), as we can't
  actually play them. It is better to give accurate information to the
  Control Point, so that it can choose an alternate format such as Wav if
  it is available.

= Mpdas-UPnP: a Last.FM scrobbler for UPnP renderers

*mpdas-upnp* is an extension to the *mpdas* MPD scrobbler.

It will monitor either an MPD or UPnP renderer instance and send
appropriate information about what is playing to Last.FM.

Both UPnP AV and OpenHome Renderers are supported.

== Building

You will need the development package libupnpp-dev.

It's found in the same place as upmpdcli packages, see
link:downloads.html[the downloads page].

If no package exist, you'll need to build and install the library, see
link:upmpdcli.html#building[here].

Then clone the repository: https://github.com/medoc92/mpdas.git
The branch to use is "upnp", it is the default branch.

Inside the mpdas directory:

    sh autogen.sh
    configure --prefix=/usr --enable-upnp
    make
    sudo make install

[[mpdas.configuration]]
== Configuration

See the README file inside the source.

In a nutshell, if the `upnpname` configuration variable is set, mpdas will
use UPnP to monitor the named renderer. The name can be either the
_friendly name_ or the UUID.

== Running

There is a `-d` option to run mpdas as a daemon. It is not shown by `mpdas
-h`, but it is in the man page.

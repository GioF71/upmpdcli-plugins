= Notes for the upmpdcli 0.11 release series

*upmpdcli* 0.11 mainly improves on the Songcast support, in complement with
the changes in *sc2mpd*. Especially, it now includes an utility (*scctl*)
and web interface to set up multi-room Songcast.

== Minor releases

=== 0.11.2

Add `upnpav` configuration variable, to enable turning off UPnP AV
support. Turning off UPnP AV allows the Linn Kinsky control point to work
smoothly with upmpdcli (it gets confused when both OpenHome and UPnP AV
services are enabled).


== Bugs fixed since 0.9.0

- Nothing very notable.
